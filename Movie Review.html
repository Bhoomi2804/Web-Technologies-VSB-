        <h2 style="text-align: center;color: burlywood;"><u>Review</u></h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;font-size: 20px;">
        What can be said about Friends that hasn't already been said? 
        It's easily one of the best sitcoms of all-time. 
        It's on every "best sitcoms ever" list for a reason...because it is! 
        If that doesn't convince you just read through these reviews and you'll see just how loved this show really is.
        The cast is perfect, not a weak link on the entire show.
        Almost everyone can find someone on the show that they identify with.
        I've seen every episode numerous times (considering it's always on) and I still laugh just as much on every watch as I did the first time I watched it.
        I'll continue to watch reruns and laugh and I doubt that I'll ever get bored with this show.
